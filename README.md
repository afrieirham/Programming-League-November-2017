# Programming League Competition - November 2017

On 8th November 2017 and 15th November 2017. I have participated in a Programming League Competition hosted by Persatuan Komputer Universiti Malaya (PEKOM). It was my first ever experience in programming competition.

The competition have 2 categories namely Open Category and Closed Category.

Basically;

Open Category - All University of Malaya student can compete.

Closed Category - Only for first year student of Faculty of Computer Science and Information Technology.
  
Obviously I took part in the closed category because there will be less competition for me and it is the most suitable for me since I am a first year student.

The competition have 2 selection round held on 8th and 15th of November 2017. Which is then leads to the Final round (24th November 2017).

Unfortunately, I am not qualified for the final round since I didn't pass the qualification round. But here is my code.
